                    Lata Mangeshkar is India's most well known playback singer.
                    She has sung in all the major Indian languages and is one of the most recorded artists in the world.

                    <h4><strong>Childhood</strong></h4>

                    Lata Mangeshkar was born on September 28, 1929 in Indore, Madhya Pradesh into a Maharashtrian Brahmin household.  Her father was Dinanath Mangeshkar and her mother was named Shudhmati.

                    Lata was the oldest of several children.  She had a younger brother named Hridayanath Mangeshkar, as well as three younger sisters named Asha (Bhosle), Usha and Meena.  (Of these Asha Bhosle would grow up to rival Lata in the world of film music.)

                    Her exposure to music began in infancy.  Her father Dinanath was an accompanied classical vocalist and was very active in the theatre.  It is said that Lata made her acting debut at the age of five in a play in which her father was participating.

                    <h4><strong>Early Career</strong></h4>
                    Lata's early film career was characterized by numerous changes in direction, false starts, and a general unsteadiness.  It was not at all clear that she was destined to be a successful singer.
